	<h1 class="section-title">CORONA VIRUS </h1>
	<p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>
	<hr>
<h2 class="section-title">SYMTOMS</h2>
	
	<p> To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following:
	<ul><span><li>Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.
		<li>Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing or sneezing.
		<li>Avoid touching your face.
		<li>Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
		<li>Stay home if you feel unwell.
		<li>Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs.
		<li>Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel and staying away from large groups of people.</span>
	</ul></p><br>

<h1 class="section-title"> Coronavirus Vaccine Progress </h1>
	<p> The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization to Pfizer/BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine for people 16 years of age and older on December 11, 2020. The push to distribute it to all 50 states began the following day in operation that was months in the making.

The CDC has recommended that healthcare workers and the elderly be the first to receive the vaccine. It could be spring or even summer before enough of the vaccine can be manufactured to help inoculate the general public.

Britain approved and began administering the same Pfizer vaccine earlier the same week of the FDA approval. Two people who received it had adverse allergic reactions, so at present time, people who have a history of severe allergies are advised not to take it. It is also unclear what affect it may have on pregnant women.

Moderna has also applied for FDA EAU for its vaccine in the U.S. Both it and the Pfizer vaccine have shown over 90% efficacy and require two doses which are administered several weeks apart. China and Russia have both developed their own vaccines which are being used in other countries.

The Pfizer vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA). This is what carries the instructions for making the “spike” protein that lets the virus enter human cells. The mRNA vaccine tells your immune cells to make the protein and act as if they’ve already been infected with the coronavirus, giving you some immunity against it.<br>

Another vaccine candidate uses DNA that’s designed to trigger an immune response to the virus.

Still another candidate uses the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) which was used to create the Ebola vaccine.<br>

Several vaccines have weakened versions of the adenovirus, one of the viruses that causes the common cold. It’s been combined with genes from the new coronavirus’ spike protein to trigger your immune system to fight it.

Yet other vaccines teach your immune system to target the coronavirus by using versions of the spike protein or the virus itself.</p>

	<h2> How Are Vaccines Developed?</h2>
	<p>The development of a vaccine against COVID-19 has taken place in an unparalled pace. Usually such a process takes years, but the scope of the pandemic triggered round-the-clock work by thousands of researchers working on over 100 different forms of the vaccine.

Effectiveness and safety were key concerns and the Pfizer vaccine approved in the U.S. for emergency use has been found to have 95% efficacy after its second dose.

Before any vaccine can be used widely, it must go through development and testing to make sure that it’s effective against the virus or bacteria and that it doesn’t cause other problems. The stages of development generally follow this timeline:

Exploratory stage. This is the start of lab research to find something that can treat or prevent a disease. It often lasts 2 to 4 years.
Pre-clinical stage. Scientists use lab tests and testing in animals, such as mice or monkeys, to learn whether a vaccine might work. This stage usually lasts 1 to 2 years. Many potential vaccines don’t make it past this point. But if the tests are successful and the FDA signs off, it’s on to clinical testing.
Clinical development. This is a three-phase process of testing in humans. Phase I usually lasts 1 to 2 years and involves fewer than 100 people. Phase II takes at least 2 years and includes several hundred people. Phase III lasts 3 or 4 years and involves thousands of people. Overall, the clinical trial process may stretch to 15 years or more. About a third of vaccines make it from phase I to final approval.
Regulatory review and approval. Scientists with the FDA and CDC go over the data from the clinical trials and sign off.
Manufacturing. The vaccine goes into production. The FDA inspects the factory and approves drug labels.
Quality control. Scientists and government agencies keep tabs on the drug-making process and on people who get the vaccine. They want to make sure it keeps working safely.</p>

	<h1 class="section-title"> VACCINE IN INDIA </h2>
	<p>A vaccine for the coronavirus will likely be ready by early 2021 but rolling it out safely across India’s 1.3 billion people will be the country’s biggest challenge in fighting its surging epidemic, a leading vaccine scientist told Bloomberg.

India, which is host to some of the front-runner vaccine clinical trials, currently has no local infrastructure in place to go beyond immunizing babies and pregnant women, said Gagandeep Kang, professor of microbiology at the Vellore-based Christian Medical College and a member of the WHO’s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety.<br>

The timing of the vaccine is a contentious subject around the world. In the U.S., President Donald Trump has contradicted a top administration health expert by saying a vaccine would be available by October. In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government had promised an indigenous vaccine as early as mid-August, a claim the government and its apex medical research body has since walked back.

For a country of its size, and with a virus curve that shows no sign of flattening, a safe and quick vaccine is a top priority for the Modi administration. The country’s broken health-care system, already struggling to deliver adequate care before the outbreak, cannot cope with the strain of a prolonged pandemic. A strict lockdown implemented in late March led to the biggest contraction among major economies with gross domestic product shrinking 23.9% in the three months to June from a year earlier.<br>

“By year-end we will have data that will tell us which vaccines are working and which ones are not going to do so well,” said Kang, who until July was heading the Indian government committee looking into prospective indigenous vaccine candidates. “If we get good results by year-end then we are looking at vaccines being potentially available in tiny numbers in first half of 2021 and larger numbers in the latter part.”

Kang said that any vaccine currently in phase three trials, whether locally made or being tested by major western pharmaceutical companies, had a 50% chance of success.<br>

Immunization Challenges
India is hosting clinical trials for all the major vaccine contenders. Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, is conducting trials for the vaccine developed by Oxford University. The drugmaker Dr Reddy’s Laboratories said last week it will distribute the Russian vaccine in India after conducting final-stage human trials and receiving regulatory approval.

India’s indigenous vaccine developers Bharat Biotech International Ltd. are at the second-phase human trial stage and Zydus Cadila is in the process to receive approvals for conducting third-phase clinical trials.

Even after an effective vaccine is available, India will be staring at storage and delivery barriers as the outbreak escalates through the nation’s hinterland. The world’s second most populous country also has no experience of, and infrastructure for, mass immunization across age groups.

“We have no life cycle immunization structures, we have no way of vaccinating the elderly who are a particular risk group here,” said Kang. “Just building the system to be able to immunize all ages is going to be a challenge.”<br>

Data Troubles
Even as the South Asian nation races to get access to a reliable vaccine to control its fast moving pandemic, its patchy testing strategy may end up underestimating the true extent of its outbreak.

India has been relying increasingly on quick antigen tests that can report false negatives as much as 50% of the time and its daily testing data doesn’t specify what type of tests -- antigen or the more sensitive real time-polymerase chain reaction tests -- make up the total or whether they were conducted on symptomatic or asymptomatic people, said Kang.<br>

Despite boosting antigen tests, India’s 8% testing positivity rate is far higher than the World Health Organization’s 5% benchmark for controlling the outbreak.

“It seems at many places antigen and RT-PCR are being used interchangeably. That doesn’t make sense to me,” she said. “It’s hard to tell whether the rate at which cases are rising will accelerate when you don’t know the testing strategy in different states.”</p>

	COVID-19 vaccines: Get the facts </h1>

	<p>Vaccines to prevent the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are perhaps the best hope for ending the pandemic. But as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) begins authorizing emergency use of COVID-19 vaccines, you likely have questions. Find out about the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccines, how they work, the possible side effects and the importance of continuing to take infection prevention steps.<br>
<hr>
<span>What are the benefits of getting a COVID-19 vaccine?</span><br>
COVID-19 can cause severe medical complications and lead to death in some people. There is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you. If you get COVID-19, you could spread the disease to family, friends and others around you.<br>

Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can help protect you by creating an antibody response in your body without your having to become sick with COVID-19.

A COVID-19 vaccine might prevent you from getting COVID-19. Or, if you get COVID-19, the vaccine might keep you from becoming seriously ill or from developing serious complications.<br>

Getting vaccinated also might help protect people around you from COVID-19, particularly people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.

What COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and how do they work?
Currently, several COVID-19 vaccines are in clinical trials. The FDA will review the results of these trials before approving COVID-19 vaccines for use. But because there is an urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines and the FDA's vaccine approval process can take months to years, the FDA will first be giving emergency use authorization to COVID-19 vaccines based on less data than is normally required. The data must show that the vaccines are safe and effective before the FDA can give emergency use authorization.<br>

Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine
The FDA has given emergency use authorization to the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Data has shown that the vaccine starts working soon after the first dose and has an efficacy rate of 95% seven days after the second dose. This means that about 95% of people who get the vaccine are protected from becoming seriously ill with the virus. This vaccine is for people age 16 and older. It requires two injections given 21 days apart.

Moderna vaccine
Moderna has applied for FDA emergency use authorization of its COVID-19 vaccine. Data has shown that the vaccine has an efficacy rate of 94.1%. This vaccine requires two injections given 28 days apart.

Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA). Coronaviruses have a spike-like structure on their surface called an S protein. COVID-19 mRNA vaccines give cells instructions for how to make a harmless piece of an S protein. After vaccination, cells begin making the protein pieces and displaying them on cell surfaces. Your immune system will recognize that the protein doesn't belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies.<br>
<hr>
<span> Can a COVID-19 vaccine give you COVID-19?</span> <br>
No. The COVID-19 vaccines currently being developed in the U.S. don't use the live virus that causes COVID-19.

Keep in mind that it will take a few weeks for your body to build immunity after getting a COVID-19 vaccination. As a result, it's possible that you could become infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or after being vaccinated.<br>

<hr>
<span>What are the possible side effects of a COVID-19 vaccine?</span><br>
A COVID-19 vaccine can cause mild side effects, including:

Pain, redness or swelling where the shot was given;
<ul><span>

<li>Fever
<li>Fatigue
<li>Headache
<li>Muscle pain
<li>Chills
</span></ul>
	Joint pain
	You’ll likely be monitored for 15 minutes after getting a COVID-19 vaccine to see if you have an immediate reaction. Most reactions happen with the first few days after vaccination and last no more than three days. If you experience side effects after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, it doesn't mean that you have COVID-19. Take time to rest and recover. If you develop a fever, stay home. However, it's not necessary to get a COVID-19 test or quarantine.<br>

	If you have a reaction that prevents you from being able to eat, sleep or work, contact your doctor. Also, contact your doctor if you have a reaction that lasts longer than three days.

	Signs of an allergic reaction include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. If you have any of these signs, seek care immediately.<br>

<hr>
<span>How are the COVID-19 vaccines being distributed?</span> <br>
Due to limited supplies, not everyone will be able to get a COVID-19 vaccine right away.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is a U.S. federal advisory group made up of medical and public health experts. The ACIP has recommended that in the first phase of vaccination in the U.S., COVID-19 vaccines should be given to health care personnel and adult residents of long-term care facilities. Other groups under consideration for early COVID-19 vaccination include workers in essential and critical industries, adults at high risk of severe COVID-19 due to underlying medical conditions, and adults age 65 and older.<br>
<hr>
<span>Is there anyone who should not get a COVID-19 vaccine?</span> <br>
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is not available to children under age 16.

There is no research on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant or breastfeeding women. However, if you are pregnant or breastfeeding and part of a group recommended to get a COVID-19 vaccine, you may choose to get the vaccine. Talk to your health care provider about the risks and benefits.

COVID-19 vaccination also might not be recommended for people with certain health conditions. Talk to your doctor if you have questions about getting the vaccine.<br>

Also, if you have a history of allergic reactions, talk to your doctor before getting the vaccine. You might need to be observed for 30 minutes after getting the vaccine.<br>

Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine even if I've already had COVID-19?
Getting COVID-19 might offer some natural protection or immunity from reinfection with the virus that causes COVID-19. But it's not clear how long this protection lasts. Because reinfection is possible and COVID-19 can cause severe medical complications, it might be recommended that people who have already had COVID-19 get a COVID-19 vaccine. If you’ve had COVID-19, wait until 90 days after your diagnosis to get a COVID-19 vaccine.<br>
<hr>
<span>Can I stop taking safety precautions after getting a COVID-19 vaccine?</span>
Experts want to learn more about the protection that a COVID-19 vaccine provides and how long immunity lasts before changing safety recommendations. Factors such as how many people get vaccinated and how the virus is spreading in communities will also affect these recommendations.

In the meantime, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends following these precautions for avoiding infection with the COVID-19 virus:

Avoid close contact. This means avoiding close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters) with anyone who is sick or has symptoms. Also, keep distance between yourself and others. This is especially important if you have a higher risk of serious illness.
Wear cloth face coverings in public places. Cloth face coverings offer extra protection in places such as the grocery store, where it's difficult to avoid close contact with others. Surgical masks may be used if available. N95 respirators should be reserved for health care providers.
Practice good hygiene. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw away the used tissue. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Avoid sharing dishes, glasses, bedding and other household items if you're sick. Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily.<br>
Stay home if you're sick. Stay home from work, school and public areas if you're sick, unless you're going to get medical care. Avoid public transportation, taxis and ride-sharing if you're sick.<br>
If you have a chronic medical condition and may have a higher risk of serious illness, check with your doctor about other ways to protect yourself.</p>
